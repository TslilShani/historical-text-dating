There are two datasets:
1. Ben yehuda Project - download from [here](https://github.com/projectbenyehuda/public_domain_dump/releases/tag/2025-03) (0.6GB)
2. Sefaria Project - download from [here](https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Project/archive/refs/tags/v6.35.0.zip) (6.96GB) (we repacked only the needed data here)

From the Ben yehuda Project we needed authors data that wan't provided. We scraped it from the website.

For setup simply unzip all the zips inside the folders.
